#A New Pomodoro Timer
I am building a different timer web app using:
  - HTML
  - Bootstrap
  - jQuery
  - NodeJS for serving the application

  ---


###User Stories:
  1. As a user, when I navigate to the page, I see a timer set to 25 minutes.
  2. As a user, when I navigate to the page, I see a start button underneath the timer that starts the time countdown.
  3. As a user, I see a 'break' button that is disabled.
  4. As a user, when I click the start button, the timer counts down to 0.
  5. As a user, when the 25 minutes is up, the break button is enabled.
  6. As a user, while the 25 minutes is counting down, the background of the page changes color from red to yellow to green.
  7. As a user, when the break button is enabled, I can click it.
  8. As a user, when I click the break button, the timer sets to 5 minutes and begins counting down.
  9. As a user, when the break button is clicked, the background color of the page gradually changes from green to yellow to red.
  10. As a user, when my mouse hovers over the break button, a tool tip will appear.
  11. As a user, when the timer ends, a noise plays.
